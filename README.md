Schema- Pizaa Store Database

The pizza order data helps in understanding customer preferences, sales performance, and ordering patterns. Using SQL, we can analyze this data by grouping orders based on pizza type, calculating total sales, and identifying the most popular pizzas. Aggregations like SUM(quantity) and COUNT(order_id) allow us to measure demand, while GROUP BY pizza_id helps rank pizzas based on sales. By joining this data with an orders table, we can gain insights into customer behavior and purchasing trends. Advanced SQL functions such as RANK() and DENSE_RANK() help identify the top-selling pizzas, while filtering with WHERE and HAVING allows us to focus on specific time periods or high-value orders. These insights can be used to optimize inventory, pricing, and promotions, ultimately improving business efficiency and customer satisfaction.
